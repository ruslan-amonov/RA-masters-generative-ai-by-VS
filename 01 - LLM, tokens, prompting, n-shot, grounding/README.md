### What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content. Unlike traditional AI that primarily identifies patterns and makes predictions, Generative AI can produce text, images, music, and even software code. This capability is driven by advanced machine learning models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Key Components and Concepts

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The overarching field of creating machines capable of mimicking human behavior.
2. **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI focused on algorithms that improve through experience.
3. **Deep Learning**: A complex form of ML involving neural networks with many layers.
4. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Advanced models like GPT that can understand and generate human language.
5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques used to make sense of human language for computational purposes.
