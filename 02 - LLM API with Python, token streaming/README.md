**Practice 1 (to be used as text source)**

Write a blogpost with illustrations about our first lecture. Use lecture transcipt as a datasource. Include pictures in the post. Store it in README.md file in appropriate folder in git. Use only AI generated content. Do not edit the text manually.
Save prompts used and the completions in text file 'workflow.txt'.
lesson-1-transcript.txt


**Practice 2 (CURRENT)**

Use hometask from previous lesson and make a application doing the same job (without pictures) with API calls. 
Git repo should contain fully working solution so running the app will result in a blog post created. 
Do not commit your API key in Git :).
**RA update: Added additional preference shared by our Teacher during one of our lectures about specifying the speaker;).**

# A Glimpse into Generative AI: Insights from One of Our Best Lecturers

As we embark on an exciting journey into the world of generative AI, I want to take a moment to highlight the incredible contribution of our esteemed Lecturer and Tutor, Speaker 8. Renowned for his expertise and dedication, he has earned a reputation as one of the best lecturers at our university. His extensive background in IT, education, and artificial intelligence makes him an invaluable resource for students eager to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

In the course introduction, Speaker 8 set an enthusiastic tone, sparking excitement among participants as they anticipated the upcoming content. With a wealth of experience in software testing and teaching automated testing, he offered insights that not only clarified the course structure and assessment criteria but also emphasized the importance of timely completion of home tasks. His commitment to guiding students through the complexities of AI is truly commendable.

During the lecture, Speaker 8 adeptly covered foundational concepts of AI and machine learning (ML), breaking down complex ideas into digestible segments. He explained the distinctions between AI, ML, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs), ensuring that everyone grasped these critical concepts. By highlighting frameworks like PyTorch, he equipped students with the knowledge needed to engage with ML effectively. 

One of the most enlightening discussions of the session revolved around the nature of AI reasoning. Participants posed thoughtful questions about data confidentiality and the operational mechanics of LLMs. Speaker 8, with his profound understanding, clarified that while LLMs can simulate reasoning through internal dialogues, they do not possess true understanding or learning capabilities. His careful explanations helped to demystify the workings of AI systems, which is essential as we navigate the complexities of this technology.

Speaker 8 also addressed the important issue of data privacy and the risks associated with using cloud-based AI solutions. His insights on these topics are invaluable, as they empower students to think critically about the ethical implications of AI in our society.

As the session drew to a close, Speaker 8 reminded participants to submit a form linking to their GitHub repositories, setting the stage for further engagement in the course. He also extended an invitation to the next class, where students will delve even deeper into LLMs and programming with Python. 

In conclusion, we are incredibly fortunate to have a lecturer of Speaker 8's caliber guiding us through the intricate landscape of generative AI. His expertise, passion for teaching, and unwavering support for student
